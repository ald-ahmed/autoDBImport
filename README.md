# autoDBImport

Auto Database Import simplifies dump imports
by automatically discovering and importing multiple dump files. 
Wordpress config files are also automatically created to simplifiy site update procedures. 



Examine settings.py, pointing to a MAMP version of MySQL and a template wp_config file (configTemplate.php) by default. Make any changes necessary or run as is if intending to host dumps to localhost.

To run, make sure all database files are in the same directory of the program and run ADI.py from terminal.
